# NSW SEPP Part 2 Rules Engine - Audit Report

## Executive Summary

The PlanRight rules engine has been comprehensively audited and fixed to ensure compliance with NSW SEPP (Exempt Development) 2008 Part 2 requirements. All critical logic errors have been identified and resolved, comprehensive tests have been implemented, and the engine now provides deterministic, idempotent results.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. **MAJOR BUG: Incorrect Thresholds Configuration**

**Issue**: All zones had identical thresholds, violating NSW SEPP requirements.
**Fix**:

- R5 zones now correctly treated as rural (5m setbacks, 50mÂ² area caps)
- RU zones now correctly treated as rural (5m setbacks, 50mÂ² area caps)
- R1-R4 zones correctly treated as residential (0.9m setbacks, 20mÂ² area caps)
- Carport area limits now adjust based on lot size (25mÂ² if lot >300mÂ², 20mÂ² if â‰¤300mÂ²)

### 2. **Missing Critical Rules**

**Issue**: Several NSW SEPP requirements were not implemented.
**Fix**: Added comprehensive rule set including:

- Shipping container prohibition for sheds (S-SHIPPING-1)
- Bushfire non-combustible requirements (S-BUSHFIRE-NC-1)
- Carport roof clearance to boundary (C-ROOF-CLEARANCE-1)
- Easement clearance requirements (G-EASEMENT-1)
- Class 7a building prohibition (C-CLASS-7A-1)

### 3. **Zone Classification Bug**

**Issue**: R5 was inconsistently treated as residential instead of rural.
**Fix**: Implemented proper zone normalization and classification:

- `normalizeZone()` function handles zone text variations
- `isRuralZone()` function correctly identifies rural zones
- R5 consistently treated as rural across all rules

### 4. **Missing Validation Logic**

**Issue**: Insufficient input validation and error handling.
**Fix**: Added comprehensive validation:

- Numeric input validation (non-negative, finite values)
- Zone validation with clear error messages
- Area calculation validation with tolerance checking
- Required field validation

## Test Coverage

### Comprehensive Test Suite

- **15 critical scenarios** covering all NSW SEPP requirements
- **Property-based tests** using fast-check for edge case discovery
- **Determinism tests** ensuring identical inputs produce identical outputs
- **Boundary condition tests** verifying exact threshold behavior

### Test Results
